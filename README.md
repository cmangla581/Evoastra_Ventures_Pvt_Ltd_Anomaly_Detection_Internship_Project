# Evoastra_Ventures_Pvt_Ltd_Anomaly_Detection_Internship_Project
This project is based on the Real world Datasets Energy Anomaly Detection, which is a type of Unsupervise Machine Learning. 

Anomaly Detection is a Ml technique that is used to identify thr data points that are very different for the normal patternin a dataset. It basically finds the unusual or suspicuous data.  

An anomaly is a data point that:  
1. Deviates strongly fromm the majority
2. Does not follow unexpected behaviour
3. May indicate an error, fraud, risk or rare event

# Here the dataset has been imported from kaggle to make all the analysis and the detections.  

Here for the anomaly detection, the graph plots have been made, for easy visualization of the anomalies.  

The anomaly detections are made on: 
1. Electricity Consumption Data
2.  GGas Consumption Data
3.  Hot Water Consumption Data
4.  Irrigation Anomaly Detection.
5.  Solar Energy Anomaly Detection
6.  Steam Consumption Anoomaly Data
7.  Water Consumption Data
8.  Weather  Anomaly Detection Data

The ML algorithms mainly used include: 
1. Isolation Forest : Used for calculating global anomalies.
2. Local Outlier Forest : Used for local anomalies.
3. Robust Covariance : Used for statistical anomalies.
